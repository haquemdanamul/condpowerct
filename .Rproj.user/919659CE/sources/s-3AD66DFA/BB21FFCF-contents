\title{calculates conditional power for Continuous or Binary Endpoint}
\usage{
continuous(n, N, delta, se, delta_assumed, zfinal)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Sample size obtained at Interim stage/look}

\item{N}{Total Sample size at Final Stage/look}

\item{delta}{Observed Treatment Effect at Interim which needs to calculate Test Statistic (Z)}

\item{se}{Standard Error for Mean(delta) difference}

\item{delta_assumed}{Assumed treatment effect for future/remaining patients}

\item{zfinal}{Final stage/Look Z-Statistic value which was obtained while planning analysis in Design Stage}
}
\value{
conditional power for specified (continuous or binary) endpoint
}
\description{
This package will calculate conditional power for stopping a trial for futility or stop for efficacy. It is possible to calculate the conditional power of the study to reject the null hypothesis given the current results obtained from gsDesign (Group sequential designs). An user has to first calculate the sample size for any types of endpoint: Continuous, Binary and Time-to-Event based on R-package gsDesign. Then using this results one can calculate the Conditional power, which is one of the tools, when computed over a range of alternatives, can be of guidance in
deciding whether to continue the study given those available information.

continuous(n=10, N=25, delta=1, se=2, delta_assumed=1, zfinal=1.97) #for Continous endpoint
continuous(n=200, N=294, delta=0.15, se=0.07, delta_assumed=0.20, zfinal=1.99) #for binary endpoint
