#' #' @description This package will calculate conditional power for stopping a trial for futility or stop for efficacy. It is possible to calculate the conditional power of the study to reject the null hypothesis given the current results obtained from gsDesign (Group sequential designs). An user has to first calculate the sample size for any types of endpoint: Continuous, Binary and Time-to-Event based on R-package gsDesign. Then using this results one can calculate the Conditional power, which is one of the tools, when computed over a range of alternatives, can be of guidance in
#' deciding whether to continue the study given those available information.
#' @examples continuous(n=10, N=25, delta=1, se=2, delta_assumed=1, zfinal=1.97) #for Continous endpoint
#' @examples continuous(n=200, N=294, delta=0.15, se=0.07, delta_assumed=0.20, zfinal=1.99) #for binary endpoint
